# Deep-Learning-Stock-Prediction

This is an experiment in stock prediction.

Problem description: Predicting the Monday opening price of a new week based on the past data of 200 stocks representative of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) from October to November 2024.

The main steps include: continuous feature discretization - cfs and k mutual information method feature selection engineering - generation of composite metrics - data scoping and structuring - construction of a multilayer LSTM cell using RNN - cyclic file reading prediction.

The project won the Second Prize of the 2nd “Greater Bay Area Cup” Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao AI for Science Competition.
